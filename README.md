# Assembly-Connect4
This is my final project for an assembly class i took while getting my Associate's at South Texas College.
It is a connect 4 game made with 32bit MASM. It can correctly place pieces, take turns, and determine when someone won.
Additionally, it includes a simple AI for users to play against. It's nothing fancy but it can correctly block when the
user is about to win, and tries to make a 4 in a row.
